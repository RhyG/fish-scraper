While it closely rivals the Blue Spot and Common Coral Trout in taste, it carries its own subtle nuances that are cherished by seafood connoisseurs.\r\n\r\nServing Suggestions:\r\n\r\nPoached with Aromatic Broth: Gently poach fillets in a flavorful broth made of chicken stock, lemon grass, kaffir lime leaves, ginger, and a touch of fish sauce. Serve with steamed jasmine rice and drizzle with some of the broth.\r\n\r\nBBQ Skewers: Cut the fish into chunks and marinate in a mix of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and chili flakes. Thread onto skewers alternately with bell peppers and cherry tomatoes. Grill until lightly charred and serve with a tangy dipping sauce.\r\n\r\nMiso Glazed: Brush fillets with a mixture of miso paste, mirin, and a bit of brown sugar. Broil in the oven until the top is caramelized and the fish is just cooked through. Garnish with sliced scallions.\r\n\r\nEn Papillote: Place the fillets on a piece of parchment paper with thin lemon slices, zucchini ribbons, fresh thyme, and a splash of white wine.
