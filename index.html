Coral trout<br><strong>(Details) Family:</strong> Coral Trout<br><strong>(Details) Description:</strong> The Common Coral Trout is a species of fish in the Serranidae family. It is large and robust, with a wide mouth and sharp teeth. This species is bright red in color, with blue spots on its body. The average length is around 60 cm, but they can grow up to 120 cm. They are one of the most commercially caught fish in Australia due to their high demand in the seafood industry.<br><strong>(Details) Category:</strong> Saltwater<br><strong>(Details) Found:</strong> The Common Coral Trout is widely distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the western Pacific Ocean. In Australia, they are commonly found in the Great Barrier Reef.<br><strong>Info/Habitat:</strong> These fish prefer coral reef habitats, particularly areas with steep coral covered slopes and deep lagoons. They lie in wait or slowly stalk their prey before quickly capturing them in powerful jaws.<br><strong>Strike times:</strong> Coral Trout are predatory species that are often most active during the dawn and dusk (crepuscular hours).<br><strong>Spearfishing tips:</strong> Coral trout are curious and often attracted to disturbance, so try and lure them into range. Aim for the head or the white lateral line running down the sides, those are the most vulnerable areas. Remember to respect marine parks and no-take zones.<br><strong>Bait Tips:</strong> Coral trout are carnivores, so live or fresh bait is most effective. Helpful bait includes small reef fish, squid, or shellfish. Setting your bait close to the bottom, where they usually dwell, will increase your catch rate.<br><strong>Lure Tips:</strong> Lures that imitate small fish are effective as trout are visual predators. Use bright colors like red, pink or orange to attract them.<br><strong>Fly Fishing Tips:</strong> For fly fishing, use baitfish or shrimp-pattern flies. Rod with a heavy line and leader is advised due to the coral trout's powerful pull and their tendency to run towards rock and corals for shelter.<br><strong>Eating rating and serving suggestion:</strong> No information available.<br></div><div class="tile"><strong>Name:</strong> Bar-cheek Coral Trout<br><strong>(Details) Scientific Name:</strong> Plectropomus maculatus<br><strong>(Details) Other Names:</strong> .
